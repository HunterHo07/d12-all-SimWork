## The Future of Work Simulation

SimWork is an AI-driven, immersive "future of work" game that combines real-world tasks with adaptive difficulty, OCR-enabled asset submission, and real-time analytics.

## Problem / Opportunity

- **Wrong Hires, Wasted Money**: Companies hire the wrong peopleâ€”time, salary, and training costs wasted.
- **Fake Skills, No Real Test**: Many pass interviews but fail on the job. No hands-on environment to prove skills.
- **Slow, Inefficient Process**: Too many rounds, test sheets, and guesswork. No live data, no real output.
- **No KPI or Proof of Skill**: Current systems lack real performance tracking.

## Solution

- **Immersive, Multi-Role Game World**: 2.5D environment with stations for Developer, Designer, PM, Data Entry, and AI Engineer roles.
- **AI-Powered Adaptivity**: GPT-based agents guide scenarios and adjust task complexity.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Dashboard tracks KPIs for accuracy, speed, and decision quality.

## Phased Rollout

### ðŸ§© Phase 1 (MVP): Web-Based 2.5D Simulation

- 2.5D Interactive Map with walkable environment
- Quest Engine with AI-powered challenges
- Embedded Tools for coding, design, and data tasks
- Progress Feedback with real-time guidance

### Future Phases

- **Phase 2**: Desktop/mobile apps, expanded role scenarios
- **Phase 3**: VR/AR integration, multiplayer enterprise modules
- **Phase 4**: API ecosystem for custom integrations
